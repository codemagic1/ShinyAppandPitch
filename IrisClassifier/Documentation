IRISCLASSIFIER USER GUIDE

IrisClassifier is a Shiny Web Application that allows the user
to view data from the iris dataset and enter four values 
(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) to predict 
the Iris Species.

Disclaimer:
  1. All fields must be filled before clicking the "Enter" button.
  2. The "Enter" button must be clicked to generate a prediction -
      simply pressing the "Enter" or "Return" key on the keyboard 
      will not do anything.
  
Users can switch between the data tab and the prediction tab to see 
the original iris dataset and the prediction computed from the inputs.
